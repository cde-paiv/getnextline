    		my project "Get Next Line" implements in C a function that reads one line from a file descriptor at a time, including the newline character. Essential for efficiently reading files, this function is widely used in data manipulation projects.
        This project was an excellent opportunity to improve my skills, especially in file manipulation and memory management.
